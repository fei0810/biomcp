You are reproducing a GeneGPT-style benchmark with BioMCP.

Answer these genomics tasks and cite BioMCP findings in-line:

1. Resolve alias and canonical symbol for BRAF.
2. Report BRAF genomic location.
3. Confirm rs113488022 maps to BRAF V600E.
4. Identify melanoma-linked evidence for BRAF.
5. List one clinically relevant BRAF-targeted therapy context.

Use BioMCP commands where needed, then provide a concise final answer.
